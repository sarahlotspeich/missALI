\title{Complete-case proportion approach to fitting regression models with missing ALI components
This function returns the dataset with an added column for the proportion of unhealthy ALI components (out of those that were nonmissing) and the fitted model.}
\usage{
cc_prop_approach(outcome, covar = NULL, data, family)
}
\arguments{
\item{outcome}{name of the outcome of the model (like \code{outcome = "disease"}).}

\item{covar}{optional, vector of names for covariates of the model (like \code{covar = c("sex", "age")}). Default is \code{covar = NULL} (no additional covariates).}

\item{data}{dataframe containing at least the variables included in \code{outcome}, \code{covar}, and the binary ALI components.}

\item{family}{description of the error distribution and link function to be used in the model, to be passed to \code{glm()}.}
}
\value{
\item{data}{dataframe with proportion of unhealthy among nonmissing ALI components.}
\item{fit}{fitted regression model object.}
}
