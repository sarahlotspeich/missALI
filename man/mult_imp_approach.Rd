\title{Multiple imputation approach to fitting regression models with missing ALI components
This function returns a list of all imputed datasets and the fitted model.}
\usage{
mult_imp_approach(
  outcome,
  covar = NULL,
  data,
  family,
  components = "binary",
  m = 100,
  post_imputation = "none"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{outcome}{name of the outcome of the model (like \code{outcome = "disease"}).}

\item{covar}{optional, vector of names for covariates of the model (like \code{covar = c("sex", "age")}). Default is \code{covar = NULL} (no additional covariates).}

\item{data}{dataframe containing at least the variables included in \code{outcome}, \code{covar}, and the binary ALI components.}

\item{family}{description of the error distribution and link function to be used in the model, to be passed to \code{glm()}.}

\item{components}{type of ALI components to be imputed. Current options are \code{components = "binary"} (the default) and \code{components = "numeric"}.}

\item{m}{number of imputations. Default is \code{m = 100}.}

\item{post_imputation}{optional, post-imputation transformation of the ALI components before fitting the model. Default is \code{post_imputation = "none"}; other options include \code{"cc_prop"}, \code{"miss_ind"}, \code{"num_miss"}, \code{"best"} case scenario, and \code{"worst"} case scenario, which call the named approaches after imputing.}
}
\value{
\item{data}{multiple imputed dataset (mids) object, returned by the mice function}
\item{fit}{fitted regression model object.}
\item{components}{reminder of whether components were treated as binary or numeric}
\item{post_imputation}{reminder of whether post-imputation transformation was performed}
