\title{Count of missing components approach to fitting regression models with missing ALI components
This function returns the dataset with added columns for the numbers of unhealthy and missing ALI components and the fitted model.}
\usage{
num_miss_approach(outcome, covar = NULL, data, family)
}
\arguments{
\item{outcome}{name of the outcome of the model (like \code{outcome = "disease"}).}

\item{covar}{optional, vector of names for covariates of the model (like \code{covar = c("sex", "age")}). Default is \code{covar = NULL} (no additional covariates).}

\item{data}{dataframe containing at least the variables included in \code{outcome}, \code{covar}, and the binary ALI components.}

\item{family}{description of the error distribution and link function to be used in the model, to be passed to \code{glm()}.}
}
\value{
\item{data}{dataframe with counts of unhealthy and missing ALI components.}
\item{fit}{fitted regression model object.}
