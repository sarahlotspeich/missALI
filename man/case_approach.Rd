\title{Best/worst case scenario approach to fitting regression models with missing ALI components
This function returns the dataset with missing values replaced by 0s (best case scenario) or 1s (worst case scenario) and the fitted model.}
\usage{
case_approach(outcome, covar = NULL, data, family, best = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{outcome}{name of the outcome of the model (like \code{outcome = "disease"}).}

\item{covar}{optional, vector of names for covariates of the model (like \code{covar = c("sex", "age")}). Default is \code{covar = NULL} (no additional covariates).}

\item{data}{dataframe containing at least the variables included in \code{outcome}, \code{covar}, and the binary ALI components.}

\item{family}{description of the error distribution and link function to be used in the model, to be passed to \code{glm()}.}

\item{best}{if \code{TRUE} (the default), then all missing ALI components are replaced with \code{"healthy"}; otherwise, they are replaced with \code{"unhealthy"}.}
}
\value{
\item{data}{dataframe with the factor versions of the ALI components (with missingness as a level).}
\item{fit}{fitted regression model object.}
}
