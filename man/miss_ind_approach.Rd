\title{Missingness indicator approach to fitting regression models with missing ALI components}
\usage{
miss_ind_approach(outcome, covar = NULL, data, family, use_glm = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{outcome}{name of the outcome of the model (like \code{outcome = "disease"}).}

\item{covar}{optional, vector of names for covariates of the model (like \code{covar = c("sex", "age")}). Default is \code{covar = NULL} (no additional covariates).}

\item{data}{dataframe containing at least the variables included in \code{outcome}, \code{covar}, and the binary ALI components.}

\item{family}{description of the error distribution and link function to be used in the model, to be passed to \code{glm()}.}

\item{use_glm}{logical argument for whether a generalized linear model (GLM) should be used (\code{use_glm = TRUE}, the default). Otherwise, a random forest is used.}
}
\value{
\item{data}{dataframe with the factor versions of the ALI components (with missingness as a level).}
\item{fit}{fitted regression model object.}
}
